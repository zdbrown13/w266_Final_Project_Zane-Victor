His employer, landlord Mike Hill (right), has also been fined\n\nLast December, eight immigration officers acting on an anonymous tip off swooped on Mr Hill's pub the Bay Horse in Denton, Greater Manchester and arrested Mr Jordan as he was working behind the bar.\n\nFather-of-three Mr Jordan, known to his friends as Carl, was warned he would be deported back to his birthplace,\n\nLicensee Mr Hill was meanwhile shocked to be issued with a Civil Penalty Notice by immigration officials for 'employing an illegal immigrant'. The fine has since been reduced to \u00a310,000 on appeal.\n\nMr Hill said: 'The whole thing is ridiculous but we don't blame Carl for any of it. He has lived here for 53 years and worked and paid his taxes since he was a teenager. How anyone can brand him an illegal immigrant is beyond me.\n\n'It would be devastated for us as this bill could send us under but it is of course more devastating for Carl too if this all went through. His daughter was in here crying her eyes out the other day in the pub and he's a loss as to what to do about it.\n\n'You hear stories of illegal immigrants being allowed to stay in the UK under some crazy human rights law yet Carl who has been paying his taxes all his life has been told he has to go. There seems to be no common sense about it.\n\nMr Jordan (pictured in Blackpool aged six) was born to a British mother and an American father in the US - but after his parents split up, his mother brought him back to the UK\n\nNow-56-year-old Mr Jordan (pictured, centre, in Blackpool aged 10) has lived in Britain ever since\n\nMr Hill added: 'When you have known someone 30 years you don't think they're American or whatever country they come from. I just think it could have been totally avoided and handled in a different way by the Home Office and whoever else.\n\n'This must have cost thousands already - even to send eight enforcement officers and lock him up overnight.'\n\nMr Jordan had been born in 1959 as the son of an American soldier and a British 'GI bride'. But when his parents split up three years later, he and his mother moved back to her native Manchester.\n\nHe was later given an American passport but didn't realise he needed British citizenship to stay in the UK. After previously working as a railway guard, he has been working in Mr Hill's pub since 2009.\n\nMr Hill said: 'I had no knowledge at all of Carl's immigration status. It was just a bit of a joke between people that he had an American passport.\n\n'I have known him for 30 years and no-one ever thought anything of it. He explained he had an American passport because he was born over there and that's it. He never applied for dual nationality because he didn't think he had to.\n\n'When he started working here we photocopied his UK driving licence as photo ID and had a P46 from his last job which had his National Insurance number on. They were the only checks we thought we had to do.'\n\nHe has been left facing potential deportation after immigration officials told him he has no right to live here\n\nHis employer, pub landlord Mike Hill, is furious after he was hit with a \u00a310,000 bill for employing him\n\nMr Hill added: 'I was at the bank on the day Carl got arrested and got phonecall off immigration saying I needed to go back to the pub.\n\n'When I got back there were eight immigration officers there and four of them were interviewing Carl. They shut the pub because they said they had to secure the building then interviewed me.\n\n'They asked me how long he had worked there and it seemed we should have got a copy of his passport and a photocopy of his birth certificate. We thought we had done everything by the book.\n\n'They say they have reduced the fine from \u00a315,000 to \u00a310,000 because I have \"co-operated\" but I can't even afford to pay \u00a310,000 - we are a small business.\n\n'Carl's worked for big international companies but it's me getting the brunt. I said to the police 'what about fining Royal Mail? He worked there for 14 years'. They said it's nothing to do with them it was me who was employing him at the time.\n\n'It's just ridiculous. It's pathetic when you realise he has paid all his taxes all these years and in two weeks time they could send him back to America where he doesn't know anybody.\n\n'It's unbelievable when you have known someone that long to hear them being called an illegal immigrant is bad enough but then to be accused of employing him as one is even worse.'\n\nThe Home Office has defended its actions insisting Mr Jordan should have sorted out his immigration status\n\nMr Jordan now has to report regularly to an immigration centre in Salford.\n\nHe said: 'I have lived here nearly all my life. I went to school here, I've worked here for 40 years - but now I've been told I've been working illegally all that time, even though I've got a National Insurance number and paid my taxes.\n\n'I've not been sleeping or eating. Every time I see my daughter she cries and that sets me off.\n\n'I thought it would be alright because I've been married here, I've got three kids and all my family are here. I didn't think it was going to get this serious.\n\n'I was only working part time at the pub anyway but Mike has had to let me go as he will get another fine if he keeps me on.'\n\nHome Office officials said Mr Jordan was warned in 2007 he needed to apply for residency but he had failed to provide enough evidence.\n\nA Home Office spokesman said: 'People born overseas to a British parent do not gain an automatic right to long term residency in the UK, and the onus is on the individual to ensure their immigration status is free of time restrictions.\n\n'We are satisfied the penalty has been correctly issued to Mr Hill as Mr Jordan has not currently or at the time of the visit established he had permission to work in the UK.\n\n'The matter of Mr Jordan having been employed by other organisations before taking up employment at the pub did not exempt Mr Hill from complying with the requirement for employers to conduct right to work checks.'"}, "split": "valid2", "summaries": [{"text": "", "policy": "pretrain_6b_t.7", "note": ""}, {"text": " 56-year-old was born in US to but British mother brought him here in 1960s.

Nick Clegg (second left) and David Cameron (right) swapped Downing Street for a tunnel deep underground for a joint visit before the Budget\n\nWearing bright orange overalls on a visit to Crossrail, the party leaders looked like they were in the cast of the 1998 film starring Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck\n\nIn the depths of the eurozone crisis in 2011, Vince Cable warned of an 'Armageddon scenario' if the single currency collapsed.\n\nBut the government hopes to set out a more upbeat picture this week, claiming to have brought the British economy back from the brink.\n\nTomorrow's Budget is expected to include a promise of tax cuts for low and middle earners, extra money for mental health and freedom for pensioners to turn their retirement into a cash lump sum.\n\nToday Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg made a joint announcement on rises in the minimum wage.\n\nWearing bright orange overalls on a visit to Crossrail, they looked like they were in the cast of the 1998 film starring Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck.\n\nMr Cameron hopes to use the Budget to catapult the Tories into a poll lead ahead of the election on May 7\n\nThe rate for apprentices will rise sharply by 57p from \u00a32.73 per hour to \u00a33.30 - 50p more than had been recommended by the independent Low Pay Commission.\n\nMinisters said the proposed small hike in the rate for apprentices failed to reflect efforts to boost the status of vocational alternatives as a way into well-paid jobs - and went beyond the recommendation for the second time in three years.\n\nMr Cameron and Mr Clegg met apprentices working on a major transport project to promote the change - in one of their last joint appearances as coalition partners before May's general election.\n\n'No-one should earn less than \u00a33 an hour,' Mr Cameron said after touring work beneath London on a station for the capital's new Crossrail link.\n\n'It is a good deal, it is right for our country and we can only do it because we have got a strong economy.\n\n'I have been talking to apprentices here who after two or three years as an apprentice could be earning \u00a325-\u00a326,000 a year. That's right. That's what I want for our country - a country where if you work hard and do the right thing you get rewarded.'\n\nMr Cameron and Mr Clegg both defended a sharp rise in the minimum wage for apprentices to over \u00a33 an hour\n\nMr Clegg said the 'vast majority' of employers already paid apprentices at least that sum but that it was right to significantly increase the minimum.\n\n'Generally governments do what the Low Pay Commission says,' he said.\u00a0'But on this occasion we felt that ... \u00a32.80 - that is still pretty low, even for apprentices to get by on.'\n\nEven though it was right that they earned less than full-time workers 'they do nonetheless need to be paid in a way that allows them to earn and learn, get their qualifications and then move on to full-time employment'.\n\nWith just two weeks until the start of the election campaign, both men will hope to avoid heading to the exit door\n\nCBI director-general John Cridland said the overruling on the apprentice rate was 'disappointing'.\n\n'The national minimum wage has been one of the most successful policies of recent years, thanks to the independence of the commission - its politicisation is worrying,' he said.\n\nConcerns were also raised by Federation of Small Businesses chairman John Allan who said the large rise came on top of other increased apprenticeship costs and would have to be 'monitored closely', and by British Retail Consortium director general Helen Dickinson who warned that any significant departure 'risks upsetting the fine balance struck by the LPC and potentially negatively impacting workers, the economy or both'.\n\nBut Sharon Spice, director of student recruitment at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), said the rise would 'help remove some of the stigma around apprenticeships being a second rate career option, making them more attractive to young people' though more funding was needed to support small businesses in offering them.\n\nTUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said there should have been a 'much bolder increase' in the main rate.\n\n'With one in five workers getting less than a living wage, this is nowhere near enough to end in-work poverty.

They are effectively being squeezed dry at the moment.'\n\nNetwork Rail own and run the 18 largest stations in the country, including King's Cross, Waterloo, Birmingham New Street, Manchester Piccadilly, Liverpool Lime Street and Leeds.\n\nThe remaining 2,500 stations are run by private franchises like Virgin, Stagecoach, First Great Western, GTR and London Midland which operates Snow Hill.\n\nFigures from the Office of Rail Regulation show that train operators last year made \u00a3772million from non-railway charges which includes parking and catering - up more than 4 per cent on the previous year.\n\nAnnual car parking fares at some train stations such as Guilford, which charges \u00a31,800 for a pass, come on top of annual travel tickets which cost more than \u00a33,000\n\nEdmund King, President of the AA, said: 'Station car parks face a difficult balancing act in not setting parking charges that are lower than those in neighbouring car parks, encouraging non-rail users to take spaces intended for train travellers. Unfortunately, this becomes an excuse for much higher parking charges, although longer-stay car parking does demand a higher and more costly level of security.\n\n'The root of the problem is the high cost of train travel - high parking charges at stations rub more salt in the wound.

It is a logical, proportionate and effective measure.\n\n'Using the revenue to set up a Children's Health Fund, paying for programmes to improve children's health and protect the environment they grow up in, would also ensure that this was a progressive measure, benefiting families in poverty and on low incomes.'\n\nPublic health directors in North West England and in Cardiff, as well as the London Health Commission, have publicly backed a sugary drinks duty.\n\nProfessor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association's scientific adviser, said: 'A tax on sugary drinks and food is a no brainer. It's a scandal that one in eight of our three-year olds currently experiences tooth decay. It's time we tackled the problem at source.'\n\nHealth campaigners and doctors have controversially likened sugar and its contribution to obesity and ill-health as the 'new tobacco'\n\nThe research looking the impact of the levy was led by Brendan Collins, Research Fellow in Health Economics, University of Liverpool, who has created a model showing the effect by local authority area across England.\n\nThis found the areas likely to see the biggest benefits by virtue of the fact they have a younger population and higher consumption of the drinks were Slough, Manchester, Luton, Blackburn, Leicester, Birmingham, Milton Keynes, Bradford and Nottingham.\n\nRobin Ireland, the director of Food Active, which is supported by Directors of Public Health in the north west of England, said: 'Just as extra taxes on cigarettes have helped to change purchasing habits and reduce smoking, adding 20p per litre onto the price of sugary drinks would encourage people to consume less and lead to improvements in quality of life.\n\n'We want to see the next Government introduce a sugary drinks duty without delay.'\n\nCitizensUK, which is an alliance of local community groups, said: 'We are calling for a Children's Health Fund to enable a step-change in early intervention. Since there is no spare money in the NHS, we are calling for a duty on sugary drinks, which will itself reduce diabetes and obesity.'\n\nDirector of the British Soft Drinks Association, Gavin Partington, rubbished the research and its figures.\n\nHe said: 'This is a flawed model based on misleading figures created by campaigners in support of their cause.

'What is this going to show to other people in this situation?' he asked.\n\n'Do they want to go through years of absolute hell for such an amount? Hundreds of people who have yet to come forward will think, \"I'm not having my life made into an open book for such a small amount.\" It's a disgrace.\n\n'No money can make up for Savile's effect on my life. But there should be some recognition from the authorities of the damage done.'\n\nMr Ashton added that his payout, which had been contested by the NHS Charitable Trust, 'is probably one day's work for the law firm that represented me'.\n\nHe added: 'You hear of celebrities receiving \u00a350,000 after having their phones hacked, but how does that compare with being sexually molested as a ten-year-old boy again and again?\n\n'I've been going through this for 40 years and I still feel Savile laughing at me.'\n\nMr Ashton's award was calculated using a compensation 'tariff', which sets payouts at between \u00a31,500 for indecent assault over clothing to \u00a340,000 for rape. Victims are entitled to more if they can prove lasting psychiatric damage or repeated abuse.\n\nThe compensation scheme, set up jointly by Savile's estate, the BBC, the NHS, children's charity Barnardos and lawyers acting for the victims, was finally approved by the Court of Appeal three months ago.\n\nPayments capped at \u00a360,000 have been awarded to more than 200 people who applied. Each claim triggers payments of up to \u00a316,000 to lawyers.\n\n'My law firm was very caring, but they will come out of this far wealthier and happier than I did,' Mr Ashton said. He added that he was advised he might be able to secure more by continuing his fight in the High Court, but decided not to as success was not guaranteed.\n\nSavile befriended Mr Ashton at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where the victim's mother Pamela worked as a spinal injuries researcher. The abuse happened in the Porter's Lodge and in Savile's private room at the hospital. Mr Ashton recalled: 'He used to say, \"This is our secret.\"\n\n'If everywhere was busy he would take me to the mortuary. He once pointed at the fridges and said, \"If you're a naughty boy for Jimmy, this is where you'll end up\".'"}, "split": "valid2", "summaries": [{"text": " Steve Ashton, who was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Savile when he was 10, was awarded only \u00a33,125 after a two year legal battle.

They later divorced.\n\nNow Miss Throssell \u2013 who had her first Mother's Day without the boys yesterday \u2013 said she has been helped through her grief by sleeping in the boys' bedroom, and has their ashes in a ring.\n\nTwo weeks ago,  a coroner recorded that Mr Sykes committed suicide, while the verdict on the two boys was unlawful killing.\n\nThe inquest in Sheffield heard that before he died from burns in hospital, Jack managed to tell police it was his father who started the fire - saying: 'My dad did it on purpose.'\n\nMr Sykes, worried over access rights to his children, had 'coldly planned' the fire at his home 'with the specific purpose of ending two young lives', the hearing was told.\n\nThe inquest heard that Mr Sykes felt 'the world was against him' after a meeting with Cafcass - which represents children in family courts - two days before the tragedy.\n\nEmotions: Miss Throssell (pictured left at the funeral for her sons, right)\u00a0said she has been helped through her grief by sleeping in the boys' bedroom, and has their ashes in a ring\n\n'To infinity and beyond': The boys quoted a catchphrase from Buzz Lightyear (above) in the Toy Story films\n\nHe formed the impression that Paul had said he only wanted to see his father for one hour a week during a discussion over visiting rights.\n\nMr Sykes lived in Penistone after the split with his wife - and his sons lived with her at their grandmother's home in nearby Thurlstone.\n\nOn the morning of the fire he contacted an investment company and withdrew his assets, transferring them into a female third party's account.\n\nHe spent \u00a3600 on model railway track and equipment and sent a text to both his sons asking them to attend the former family home that evening to play with the new train set and be 'engine drivers'.\n\nMr Sykes then bought petrol cans, fuel and posted letters to family and friends - and deliberately parked his van away from his house so neighbours would not realise anyone was at home.\n\nHe picked up his sons on the evening of October 22 last year to play with the model railway and while they went up to the loft, he set the fire.\n\nFuneral:\u00a0Mr Sykes lived in Penistone after the split with his wife - and his sons lived with her in Thurlstone\n\nFamily: In a statement to an inquest earlier this month, Miss Throssell said her 'boys meant the world to me'\n\nThe inquest heard that after he had barricaded the door after lighting a fire in the bottom floor of the house, he then came out of the house through the patio doors and walked round to the front door, letting himself in and locking it behind him.\n\nHe took the keys upstairs before lighting more fires on the first floor, including in the children's bedrooms. Once this was done he then entered the loft, closing the hatch behind him.\n\nMr Sykes sent the same text to six separate people saying he was 'going to be at peace'. A minute later, neighbours spotted the blaze and the fire service were called with the downstairs well ablaze.\n\nCord had been tied to the front and back garden gates as a barricade and a dining chair placed between the kitchen door and the door to the stairs so nobody could escape downstairs.\n\nPetrol was used as an accelerant to start the fire with 16 pools of fuel on the ground floor and first floor. A patio door had been left partly open downstairs to fan the flames.\n\nIn a statement to the inquest earlier this month, Miss Throssell said: 'My boys meant the world to me. They were both polite, well-mannered and caring, and you can't imagine life without them.'\n\nBuzz Lightyear is a space ranger hero and action figure owned by a boy in the Toy Story films.

I myself am one of such people!\n\n'I decided to take a look and my initial assumption was that there would be an effect and quite a strong one. Good weather equals better mood.\n\n'However, this didn't turn out to be true. There are some weak effects in a naive correlation framework  but when we go to a more complex multivariate framework (i.e. we control for certain factors such as age, sex, location, etc) all this disappears.\n\nThe research, which will be presented by the\u00a0Royal Economics Society next week,\u00a0searched for\u00a0correlations between happiness and temperature, sunshine, rainfall and wind speed.\n\nThe research, which also found that people dislike their jobs more when the sun's shining, will come as a surprise to most weather-obsessed Brits. Above, sunbathers enjoy Brighton Beach in 17.5C heat last week\n\nThe study was conducted by Franz Buscha, above, principal research fellow at the University of Westminster\n\nHe added: 'The end result is that - much to my surprise - the effect of the weather on people's well-being is non-existent.\n\n'Perhaps this is not surprising - when somebody asks you a question such as a) how do you rate your current well-being on a scale of 1 to 10 should weather really\u200b influence your answer?\n\nUp to one in four Britons suffer from seasonal affective disorder, with seven per cent of the population having full-blown SAD.\n\nSAD is also know as the 'winter blues' as victims feel their symptoms begin with the turn of the season into Autumn.\n\nIn diagnosed cases, the symptoms can be so severe that they can cost people their jobs and break up relationships.\n\nThe effects vary from mild - tiredness during the day and over-eating - to very serious, such as joint pains, stomach upsets, loss of libido and even aggressive behaviour.\n\nSAD is triggered by a biochemical imbalance in the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that rules our body's main functions, such as sleep, appetite, sex drive, temperature, mood and activity.\n\nWhen the days are long, natural light passes through the eye to the retina until it reaches the hypothalamus and stimulates these natural functions.\n\nBut if there is insufficient light, they begin to slow down and gradually stop - similar to a car running out of fuel.\n\nIn recent years, however, there has been growing evidence that there are many ways to reduce the chances of developing SAD or even to prevent it.\n\n'People's well-being is driven by life events such as income, employment, health, family, death of a loved one, winning in the lottery, etc.\n\n'It seems we are all smart enough not to be influenced by a bit of rain!'\n\nWhat Mr Buscha's paper did assert is that people's job satisfaction is negatively impacted on sunny days.\n\nThe paper makes a clear distinction between daily weather and seasons. Mr Buscha did find significant evidence of seasonal affective disorder (Sad) whereby individuals become markedly less happy during the winter because of a lack of light.\n\nSAD is also know as the 'winter blues' as victims feel their symptoms begin with the turn of the season into Autumn.\n\nIn diagnosed cases, the symptoms can be so severe that they can cost people their jobs and break up relationships.\n\nHe added: 'One other thing to keep in mind, the paper talks about and short run weather variations (i.e. 5 days of rain type stuff). There is quite strong evidence that we all feel a bit unhappier in the winter.'\n\nMr Buscha's findings may be seen as unimportant but levels of well-being are becoming a focus for the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThe research fellow suggested that a future line of inquiry could be a study into extreme weather.\n\nHe added: 'The top five hottest years ever have all been in the last 10 to 15 years.\n\n'Quite extreme weather patterns are starting to appear.\u00a0There is an interesting question about what the effect of this will be.'"}, "split": "valid2", "summaries": [{"text": " People don't seem to be affected by the weather one way or another!

Scott Walker for signature", "article": "Wisconsin lawmakers voted Friday to make their state the 25th to enact 'right-to-work' legislation, pushing a fast-tracked bill through the Assembly after an overnight debate and sending it on to Gov. Scott Walker for his promised signature.\n\nThe Assembly passed the bill 62-35 after a marathon session that included about 20 hours of debate. It was a straight party-line vote, with no Democrats backing the contentious measure that will ban unions from forcing non-members to pay dues.\n\nA likely 2016 presidential candidate who rose to national prominence by taking on public-sector unions four years ago, Walker plans to sign the right-to-work legislation into law on Monday.\n\n'Today is the day we have solidified the regressive era in Wisconsin,' Democratic Rep. Terese Berceau, of Madison, said minutes before the vote.\n\nA likely 2016 presidential candidate who rose to national prominence by taking on public-sector unions four years ago, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker plans to sign the right-to-work legislation into law on Monday\n\nMary Will, left, with Local 68, and Corey Smith, right, with Local 113, chant 'Union Strong' during a rally inside the Wisconsin State Capitol as the state Assembly debates the right-to-work bill in Madison, Wisconsin on Thursday.\u00a0The Assembly passed the bill 62-35 on Friday after a marathon session that included about 20 hours of debate\n\nWisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, walks off the floor after passage of right-to-work on Friday. The bill passed on a party-line vote, with Republicans in support and all Democrats against. The Senate passed it last week\n\nThe proposal would make it a crime punishable by up to nine months in jail to require private-sector workers who aren't in a union to pay dues.\n\nSupporters argued it would make Wisconsin more attractive to businesses looking to move in or expand. But opponents said the goal is to destroy unions, which tend to vote Democrat, and a right-to-work law would depress wage and create more dangerous workplaces, in turn hurting the economy.\n\nTwenty-four other states have right-to-work laws. Michigan and Indiana were the two most recent states to enact it, both in 2012.\n\nThe protests from unions in Wisconsin were not nearly as large as they were four years ago when Walker and Republicans in the state legislature pushed through reforms to public sector unions, growing only as large as about 3,000 people compared with 100,000 in 2011.\n\nAnd only a handful of protesters were on hand for Friday's deliberations.\n\nTwo people were arrested Thursday for refusing to stop screaming profanities, a spokesman for Walker's administration said.\n\nThe vote came after Walker said in September, during his re-election campaign, that right-to-work was not a priority and wouldn't come up this session.\u00a0Walker called it a distraction and feared that protests would grow as large as those in 2011 when he effectively ended collective bargaining for most public workers\n\nLegislative leaders, including Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, also said right-to-work would not be debated.\n\nBut two weeks ago, when Senate Republicans said they were going forward with it, Walker said he would sign it\n\nPointing out that 'the bill would be dead if he opposed' it, Arnold Shober, a political science professor at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, told TPM last week that Walker had to side with his party on the issue.\n\n'He knows that it will court controversy, but he cannot afford to lose potential GOP primary voters,' Shober said.\n\nA protester chants  outside of the Assembly chamber during debate on right-to-work legislation at the State Capitol on Thursday. Opponents say the goal of the proposal is to destroy unions, which tend to vote Democrat\n\nOpponents of the Wisconsin legislature's 'right-to-work' measure rallied at the state Capitol last Saturday. The proposal, due to be signed next week by Walker, would outlaw the mandatory payment of union dues from workers\n\n'Legislative leaders know this, and see now as an opportunity to pass right-leaning legislation while the state political climate is very favorable.'\n\nWalker is scheduled to be in Iowa for an agriculture summit on Saturday that's attracting other likely Republican presidential candidates.\n\nThe Wisconsin executive's well-established intentions to compete for the Oval Oval next year had state Democrats accusing their Republican colleagues of pressing the issue to help Walker's likely presidential campaign, even though Walker had said he didn't want the fight as he turned his eye to national politics.\n\nThey called on Walker to veto the bill.\n\n'It's the workers in this state that are suffering through the politics of our governor's ambitions,' said Democratic Rep. Cory Mason of Racine.\n\nVos accused Democrats of having 'Walker derangement syndrome,' and said the bill was about giving workers the freedom to choose whether to pay union dues.\n\n'I'm not going to apologize about using the word freedom,' said Republican Rep. Jeremy Thiesfeldt of Fond du Lac. 'I'm going to use it over and over again because that's what this is about.'\n\nDemocratic Rep. LaTonya Johnson of Milwaukee, and a member of AFSCME, said she cares about people more than freedom.\n\n'It just angers me to know that we come here and we pass bills that affect people's everyday lives and we don't have a clue as to how those everyday people live or how they survive,' Johnson said.

For me when I saw the red card I was like \"the guy doesn't know what he's doing\".\n\n'That is not the worst. The worst is when I got the red card all the Chelsea players come around. It felt like I had a lot of babies around me.'\n\nChelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers as the Dutchman sends off Zlatan Ibrahimovic (far right) on 31 minutes\n\nIbrahimovic heads into a challenge with Chelsea midfielder Oscar (left) in the first-half which saw him sent off\n\nThe PSG forward immediately acknowledged his fault in the incident having collided with Oscar\n\nChelsea captain John Terry (left) reacts after Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar in the first-half at Stamford Bridge\n\nMourinho said he hoped the red card could be overturned but also bemoaned a penalty not given for a trip on Diego Costa and what he thought might be an elbow on Costa by David Luiz.\n\nThe Chelsea manager also blamed his own players for failing to deal with their numerical advantage, wilting under expectations and conceding twice from set-pieces.\n\n'When a team cannot defend two corners a team doesn't deserve to win,' said Mourinho. 'We couldn't cope with the pressure. For them it was easy, two lines of four, counter-attack, waiting for the right moment. Mentally for them with 10 there is nothing to lose.\n\nChelsea players look dejected after being dumped out of the Champions League at home to PSG\n\n'Our performance was not good enough. The opponent was stronger than us, they coped better with the pressure of the game. Because they had 10 men we felt more the pressure of winning and they had nothing to lose.\n\n'We couldn't cope with that, we conceded two goals in two set pieces. That is difficult to accept. For me it was a surprise. I am disappointed, but I try always to be pragmatic and honest. The first feeling was that we deserved to lose. We didn't deserve to go through.\n\n'It's not the moment to explain. We will analyse it. We need to react. We have a Premier League to win. I told that to the players. We lost a competition where even if we win today there are other big teams to beat.\n\n'We have the Premier League to win and we are in a good situation. There's no time to cry. Move on, and look forward.'\n\nFormer Chelsea man David Luiz gestures towards Blues striker Diego Costa during Wednesday's encounter\n\nPSG defender  Luiz celebrated excitedly after scoring against his former club at Stamford Bridge\n\nThiago Silva's late header loops over the outstretched arm of Thibaut Courtois to knock Chelsea out\n\nOn Ibrahimovic's red card, Mourinho said: 'I spoke to him after the game and when he speaks with me he's always honest. He would tell me if it was a reason for a red card, and he was very disappointed so if that's the case, I hope they can minimise the mistake and let him play the quarter-final. If he did nothing wrong, he deserves that.\n\n'But the other situations, it was a clear penalty on Diego Costa and, once more, I think it's a waste of time and money to have the officials on the side of the goal. If he cannot see a penalty 10 metres when it's completely clear, it's a waste of time and money.\n\n'The David elbow I didn't see, I confess. But when UEFA give him the man of the match, I have to believe there's no elbow. Perhaps they cannot give us the penalty but maybe they can do what is fair and suspend David and take Ibra into the quarter-finals.'\n\nIbrahimovic also suggested Oscar feigned injury.\n\n'I pulled out (of the tackle), because I saw him come in the tackle.\n\n'I don't know if he was acting afterwards. Doesn't matter.

Commuting time made up just under 3 1/2 hours of that.\n\nThe report was based on data from the U.S. Census from 1990 and 2000 and the 2013 American Community Survey.\n\nBusy schedules:\u00a0The report said a typical week for a full-time New York worker adds up to more than 49 hours, including an average of more than six hours of commuting time. Commuters are seen in New York in 2014\n\nResearch: New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer released the findings in a report on Tuesday. Stringer is seen here in this March 5, 2015 file photo\n\nStringer said commuting times were longer for lower-wage workers, who were more likely than higher-wage workers to live in parts of the city that aren't as well-served by public transportation.\n\nSecurity guards, for example, on average spent more than eight hours a week commuting.\n\n'Nursing and home health aides and maids and housekeepers also report long commutes, while chief executives, taxi drivers and physicians and surgeons report the shortest commutes,' the report said.\n\nIn a statement, Stringer said 'New York is America's hardest working city, but it's a one-two punch for lower wage workers, who get paid less and travel longer to get to work.\n\n'This means employees in the Big Apple get paid less than it appears on an hourly basis, because their commutes are significantly greater than anyone else in the country.'\n\nThe report found that 'In New York City, workers in the finance sector, on average, work the longest workweeks. With usual work schedules topping 47 hours, New York City financial workers spend, on average, almost four hours more per week working than do their counterparts in other large cities.'\n\nIt also said that workers in advertising, media, computer, legal services, arts and entertainment, food service, and retail trade have longer hours compared to people with jobs in those industries in other major US cities.\n\n'But longer workweeks are not characteristic of all New York City industries,' the report said. City workers in manufacturing, real estate, and health care, for example, work fewer hours in a typical week than do workers in those industries in other large cities.'\n\nStringer said the report showed a need for the city to expand its transit networks, as well as promote flexible work arrangements along with predictable scheduling.\n\n'If New York City is going to symbolize the American Dream, we can't be a nightmare when it comes to long work hours and commuting,' Stringer said in the statement. 'Our residents deserve better.'\n\nLong day: Though New York workers have an average work week of 42.5 hours, in San Francisco workers work approximately 44 hours per week\n\nNote: All figures are listed in hours, minutes.\n\n1.

'She's been there with me through thick and thin.'\n\nDespite her severe condition, Laura miraculously managed to make a full recovery after spending two weeks in the hospital \u2013 but sadly her illness was just one of her many set backs.\n\nWhen Laura first traveled to Houston to meet with Dr Nowzaradan, she was told that she needed to shed 50lbs from her 594lb frame before being eligible for gastric bypass.\n\n'She is physically in one of the worst shapes I have ever seen,' the doctor said of Laura, who was a diabetic and needed an oxygen tank and a wheelchair with her at all times.\n\nAfter Laura lost the necessary weight, Dr Nowzaradan proceeded with the surgery, only to find in the midst of the procedure that Laura's liver and spleen were far too large for her to actually undergo the gastric bypass.\n\nEmotional trauma: When Laura was a young child (L), she didn't have a problem with her weight.

a human ancestor that lived 1.8 million years ago and is thought to have been among the first to use tools - earning it the nickname 'handy man'.\n\nIt reveals an unexpectedly primitive structure, indicating that the species may have originated at least 2.3 million years ago and allowed the researchers to draw conclusions about what their ancestors jaw would have looked like.\n\nTheir findings suggest that three different species of early human existed side-by-side between 2.1 million and 1.6 million years ago -

a human ancestor that lived 1.8 million years ago and is thought to have been among the first to use tools - earning it the nickname 'handy man'.\n\nIt reveals an unexpectedly primitive structure, indicating that the species may have originated at least 2.3 million years ago and allowed the researchers to draw conclusions about what their ancestors jaw would have looked like.\n\nTheir findings suggest that three different species of early human existed side-by-side between 2.1 million and 1.6 million years ago -

a human ancestor that lived 1.8 million years ago and is thought to have been among the first to use tools - earning it the nickname 'handy man'.\n\nIt reveals an unexpectedly primitive structure, indicating that the species may have originated at least 2.3 million years ago and allowed the researchers to draw conclusions about what their ancestors jaw would have looked like.\n\nTheir findings suggest that three different species of early human existed side-by-side between 2.1 million and 1.6 million years ago -

a human ancestor that lived 1.8 million years ago and is thought to have been among the first to use tools - earning it the nickname 'handy man'.\n\nIt reveals an unexpectedly primitive structure, indicating that the species may have originated at least 2.3 million years ago and allowed the researchers to draw conclusions about what their ancestors jaw would have looked like.\n\nTheir findings suggest that three different species of early human existed side-by-side between 2.1 million and 1.6 million years ago - Homo habilis, Homo erectus and Homo rudolfensis.\n\nScientists used 3D imaging techniques to reconstruct the skull of Homo hablis (left) which has provided clues about how this now extinct member of our evolutionary branch would have looked. The image on the right shows an early reconstruction of Homo hablis at the\u00a0Westf\u00e4lisches Museum for Archaology in Herne\n\nThey found that the ancestor of Homo habilis would have had features similar to those found in the fossilised jawbone LD 350-1.\n\nProfessor Fred Spoor, a researcher of evolutionary anatomy at University College London and the Max Planck Institute in Germany, said: 'By digitally exploring what Homo habilis really looked like we could infer the nature of its ancestor, but no such fossils were known.\n\n'Now the Ledi-Geraru jaw has turned up as if 'on request', suggesting a plausible evolutionary link between Australopithecus afarensis and Homo habilis.'\n\nThis reconstruction of the jaw of Homo habilis by the UCL team shows that it was more primitive than the jaws of Homo erectus or Homo sapiens and was more similar to the jaw of \u00a0Australopithecus afarensis\n\nDr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said the discovery of LD 350-1 could help scientists unravel the complex beginnings of our own species.\n\nHe said: 'It gives us a better understanding of what was happening at the earlier end of the genus Homo.\n\n'Finds like Kenyanthropus (a 3.5 million year old ape-like species) have made it harder to understand the relationship between the Australopithecines and us - in short it's the replacement of the old fashioned unilinear model of a evolutionary branch with a multiple species based evolutionary bush.\n\n'What's becoming clear is that we have only a small part of the jigsaw puzzle. This new fossil may well be a member of our genus, an australopithecine or an hitherto unknown genus.'"}, "split": "valid2", "summaries": [{"text": " Jawbone - known as LD 350-1 - was discovered in Afar region of Ethiopia.

Arias, shown above on different days of the testimony, spoke on condition of media not being allowed to film - but a legal challenge forced the court to hand over records\n\nThe footage, recorded in October and November of last year, was only released after media organizations challenged the decision to allow the secret testimony, and asked for full records.\n\nAuthorities at the Maricopa County Superior Court have now released video footage of Arias, in which she is questioned by defense attorneys.\u00a0ABC News\u00a0ran portions of the film on Friday.\n\nThe questioning began with Arias openly admitting the murder - but saying she did not admit her guilt to anybody until 2010 because she was so shocked at herself.\n\nWhen asked why she did not confess immediately, she said: 'Because what I did was so horrific that I couldn't have - I could never have imagined myself doing that to another human being.'\n\nAlexander, 30, was found dead in a shower in his Phoenix-area home in 2008. He had been stabbed more than 20 times, his throat was cut almost from ear to ear, and he had been shot in the face.\n\nTogether: The secret testimony included questions about Arias' time with Alexander, whom she repeatedly stabbed, then shot\n\nShe was then asked for her reaction to hearing of the grief of Alexander's family - and said that it made her wish she could undo the killing, which she claims was an act of self-defense.\n\nShe said: ' I wish so badly that I could just take that away from them, and that I could reverse what I did, and that I could take away what all these people are feeling that I have hurt, including Travis.\n\nShe also admitted lying to a detective, whom she called of her own volition, about the murder.\n\nWhen confronted with footage of interviews she gave, Arias branded herself 'revolting'.\n\nShe said: 'It was something that I was years from being able to even come around to admitting to myself that I did something that horrible.\n\n'[Lying to police about the murder] is revolting. I look at that [footage], I just think about how stupid I was.\n\n'I was lost - I think of what just those lies put so many people through, and I just wish I could - there are a lot of things I wish I could do over again, but that is just one of them.'\n\nWhen asked to recall photographs of Alexander's mutilated body, she said: 'I caused that pain, and those were his last moments; and it makes me sick and I wish so badly that I could just so that whole day over again'.\n\n'I caused that pain': Arias reacted to gruesome pictures of Alexander's body, which had some 30 stab wounds. The above image of the shower where his corpse was found is among the publishable ones\n\nMost of the rest of the testimony focuses on Arias's childhood and her past relationships, and also the time she first met Alexander, at a convention in Las Vegas.\n\nShe described having sex with him for the first time, and how he started suggesting that she join the Mormon church.\n\nThe line of questioning was never completed,  because Arias refused to continue her testimony after the promise of secrecy was removed.\n\nThe jury, eight men and four women, ultimately failed to reach a verdict after one of the women voted against the death penalty.\n\nAfter the trial, fellow jurors said the holdout juror was biased. Many said Arias did not genuinely feel remorse, and was trying to manipulate them.\n\nThe judge in the retrial will decide on April 13 whether Arias will spend the rest of her life in prison or if she will be eligible for release after serving 25 years.\n\nSince going back to prison, she has been punished for breaking jailhouse rules - and will not be able to buy items such as candy, has had 10 visitors banned, and will not be able to make phone calls unless they are to do with her legal case."}, "split": "valid2", "summaries": [{"text": " Jodi Arias speaks in secret, admits she killed her boyfriend but says she did not confess to anyone at the time because she did not imagine herself doing it", "policy": "sup4_6b_t0.7", "note": null}, {"text": " Convicted killer spoke in sentencing retrial where she dodged execution.
