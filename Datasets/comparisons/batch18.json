They were angry at everything and everyone and always unleashed that on me and my brother.\n\nWhen we were 16 we ran away from home. We lived on the streets for a while until we were able to rent a room together. When we were 19 our dad was killed by the police. Our mom killed herself a few months later so we got their stuff. We sold their house and bought a new one and that's where we live right now.\n\nWe focused on getting professional help, trying to heal and moving on. I've been able to do that. Now I have friends, I'm in a relationship for a year with my boyfriend and my life is pretty normal. My brother however has struggled. His progress has been much slower than mine and he still isn't in a great shape. He struggles with making friends and having relationships. Therapy helps and he's getting better but it's a long and slow process for him.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't really been helpful to be honest. He thinks I shouldn't help my brother since I don't owe him anything and that he's and adult and responsible for his own problems. Last night we woke up because we heard my brother screaming in his sleep (it sometimes happens, though not often anymore) and I went to his room to help him calm down and go back to sleep. He has nightmares about what our parents did to us. This morning boyfriend told me that my brother is a mess and he belongs in a mental institution. I didn't like what he said so I told him that I don't need his \"expert\" psychological opinion. He continued that I should cut him lose since he'll never be a good brother for me as he's too damaged and beyond anyone's help. I became angry and told him that he should leave.\n\nI'm very upset with the things he said. I find his comments not only out of line and insulting but also very wrong. He texted me a \"I'm sorry if I upset you\" apology. I don't know what I should do with him.", "title": "Me [22F] & brother [22M] with childhood trauma.

I met him several weeks ago when I first moved in. I panicked when my friend asked me if I was interested in her and told him no and that he should go for her.

(No hand biting, growling, snapping, etc) He is really shy around someone he first meets but other than that he's fine. As soon as I got to the vet my dog was clearly nervous/scared/anxious. After waiting for almost an hour to be seen I managed to calm him and have him sit next to me on a bench. Once our name was called, however, the noise from inside scared him out again.(trying to go back out and having his tail down) The lady who takes my dog is clearly irritated at the type of breed I have. She talked to me as if I knew nothing about the breed and snapped angrily about how aggressive the breed was. After waiting for the nurse to return with my dog she proceeded to tell me about how my dog is EXTREMELY people aggressive and ill have a lawsuit on my hands if I don't fix it. Then handed me 50 million pamphlets on dog trainers in my area. What should I do? What's the best course of action? Get my dog evaluated? Or go to a different vet? It' crazy because I've been going to this one my whole life and never had an issue.", "title": "[HELP][VENT]The vet told me my dog is EXTREMELY aggressive.

The all believe they are hardasses and want to fight me and through their stupidity I believe they may begin to endanger my friends and family. **Context** - It is a group of four guys, my buddies and I used to be friends with but they just got stupider and stupider so we completely stopped associating ourselves with them. A few weekends ago they heard I was talking shit about them. I wasn't.... But they thought I was so it began with dumb prank calls, but soon they took their \"fun\" to one of my buddies cars and in the middle of the night and coated it with syrup and penut butter. He knew it was them and did nothing about this. Now they're calling me on private numbers and screaming swears and other \"demeaning\" things at me and its easy to tell its them because of their foreign accents. One of them slipped up and forgot to block his number so I assume thats a bit of evidence against them. They have also threatened me bodily harm through these calls and want me to fight them.  I know where they all live and feel its best to just talk to the police and give them their addresses and names and explain the situation, I can not deal with the anxiety of them causing any kind of damage to my home or endangering my family and friends (or myself for that matter).

I'm pretty comfortable at her house so I have no issue shitting there. Usually I use a bathroom connected to the guestroom, which is rather secluded from the rest of the house so as to not hot box the whole family. Today, however, her sister was home from college and napping in the guestroom, so I was forced into \"the outhouse\", a little used, lock-less bathroom barely big enough to fit a toilet in, which just so happens to be next to the main communal area of the house. \n\nNow I'm in the bathroom, and in the process of unleashing a hellacious megladon of a shit into the basin below.

In a hurried panic I wash my hands and swiftly exit The Outhouse, sans flushing.\n\nFast forward a half hour and we're eating lunch at Costco because $1.50 for a hot dog and soda is an unbeatable deal. All of a sudden she gets a text from her mom, \"Did someone use The Outhouse?\". As she reads me the text, it hits me that I have just left a massive turd burger marinating in piss for a half hour in the middle of their home. My girlfriend sees the look of horror on my face and immediately starts to figuratively lose her shit in the middle of Costco. She quickly relays to her mom who the culprit was and just how embarrassed I am. A couple minutes pass and this text comes back: \"No.. it's fine, it's just that he should really get checked out.

{"info": {"id": "t3_3ocz7c", "post": "I'm studying engineering, on my second year of a four or five year degree. Engineering is not an easy major and on top of that I'm also working as a lab tech, a tutor, and participating in a NASA competition/scholarship. As you can guess, I'm a busy guy and even when I come home for the day, I typically have work to do until 6-8pm. \n\nI do my best however to make sure that my Friday evenings and all day Saturday are free for me and my fiance to spend time together. Even when I'm working in the evenings it's not like we're very far apart, we have an open concept apartment and I'm typically just ten feet away at the kitchen table doing my thing while she watches TV in the living room.

My car was totaled after sniping out of control and Kim (I must say, i think she's a total brat and i highly dislike her but my sister begged me to take her to her house, so i did) ended up in the hospital to get stitches in her head.

This is complicated by the fact that we live in the same neighborhood, went to college together and share some common acquaintances.\n\nEven though breaking up was very hard on me, I also stupidly followed through on a macho impulse to act as though it didn't particularly bother me at the time and, when she asked me how I was so calm, told her that it just felt better now that we had made a decision.\n\nSo, I think this adds up to me having been a jackass. And I really regret it because I have no end of respect for this woman. I've thought on and off about reaching out to apologize because it seems like the right thing to do, but I don't want to weird her out now 6 months out from breaking up.\n\n I have no desire to get back together with her, nor do I think she'd be interested in dating me again. However, I'd love for us to be on decent terms and feel like I probably messed that up. \n\nWhat do you all think?

We have a steady relationship and we're very happy.\n\nEarly in the relationship, I went to my friends cousin's house to hang out. My bf didn't come. We were all hanging out and drinking and another of my friend's cousins who I had kissed a few years back showed up. \n\nI got really drunk. The cousin was trying really hard to sleep with me, I kept saying no and he knew I had a boyfriend. \n\nEventually I blacked out. I found out in the morning that the guy kept trying to get me to sleep in his bed with him which I refused (thank god). However someone told me that i was leaning against him on the couch and she wasnt sure but he may have been kissing my neck.\n\nI felt absolutely disgusted after I found this out. I had a huge talk with my friend and she thought it was best for me not to mention it to my boyfriend because it was a new relationship and I had been adamant that I didn't want to hook up with him. I didn't say anything to him.\n\nI hadn't really thought about it much until recently. About six months ago I came to terms with the fact that I have an alcohol abuse problem. I've been sober now for three months.

{"info": {"id": "t3_2uuz5f", "post": "Hi everyone, I joined recently and after reading the \"Not knowing what a potato was\" post, I remembered this and told a colleague, he told me to post it here since we always read TIFU.\n\nAnyways, this was about 2-3 years ago, I was driving behind a car that had a sign on the back which read \"Heritage Carpets\". there was a little space between \"Car\" and \"pets\" which wasn't too big to look like separate words but big enough to, as my colleague said, \"confuse you\". Me being stupid I read this as \"Car Pets\" and kept thinking and then laughing to wtf this meant, still not realising like a dumbass, I then take a pic so i can show my friends and have a good laugh.\n\nNow the reason for my stupid confusion was because of a car showroom near my area which I used to drive pass a lot and always look at what new car they displayed. The font and colours were similar and I just thought of \"Heritage Cars\" straight a way.\n\nSo after taking that pic, I met up with a friend and showed him the pic, i kept saying \"wtf is a Heritage CAR PET?\" and laughing, he gave me a weird look and said \" you mean carpets...?\"\n\nI felt so stupid, deleted the pic and tried to quickly move on from that subject, he laughed a little but then forgot about it.
