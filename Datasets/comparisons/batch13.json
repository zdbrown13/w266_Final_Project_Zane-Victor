{"info": {"id": "t3_270s7x", "post": "My friend Danielle was engaged for 4 years in what I can only describe as an extremely toxic relationship (gaslighting and cheating galore in both directions). She finally broke up with him a little under a year ago, and quickly began dating someone new. I have only met the new guy (Mark) a couple of times, but they seem like a far better fit and like they are happy together.\n\nRecently Danielle told me that she wants to get pregnant in the next few months. I didn't say anything about this at the time, but there are a few reasons why I think this would be a bad idea.\n\nFirstly (and least significantly), her and Mark have only been together for about 5 months, and she started dating him really soon after she broke up with her fiance.\n\nSecondly, she isn't mentally stable. I'm not entirely sure what she has been diagnosed with, but it is something like borderline personality disorder or extreme depression. This manifests itself in the form of panic attacks, neurosis, depression and narcissism. She claims that she cannot afford medication, even though we live in a country where prescriptions are incredibly cheap, and you can get free repeat prescriptions. Her not being medicated has led to her being fired or quitting her last few jobs.\nI don't think she realises just how expensive and mentally draining having a child can be. I think it's important that she focuses on getting well before considering having children. I don't think it would be fair to bring up a child in the environment that she can currently offer it.\n\nShould I talk to her about my concerns, or would I be massively out of line for doing so? I'm not sure that she would react well or take what I say on board. I know another of my friends agrees with me, and would probably have another point or two to add, so I could potentially have back up if I were to talk to her.

We didn't because most of the issues we have  are because of Max, a 22 year old stoner who spends the majority of his day playing video games.

At Max's request, I've stopped coming over as much and doing certain things that bother him, such as coming in from the backdoor, knocking on the window to have someone unlock the door, bringing over extra changes of clothes, etc. All of these requests are reasonable enough but they have brought stress onto my relationship nonetheless. Other than that, we get along OK.\n\nWhile my boyfriend and I were fighting, I called Max \"a useless piece of shit.\" It was unnecessary and I certainly regret it, but it was honest. However, though we were outside, one of my boyfriend's other roommates overheard when he came to smoke a cigarette and told Max what I said. My boyfriend isn't asking me to apologize to Max, but obviously that's what he would like me to do.\n\nSo here's my issue: I don't mind apologizing to Max but I feel like the informant roommate shouldn't have said anything to Max in the first place.

A beat-up, rusty van parked in my apartment parking lot hadn't moved in weeks if not months. The license plate was expired as of December 2012 so I took a picture and emailed my landlord. I thought perhaps someone had abandoned it (looking back, they probably wouldn't have left the license plate on it, but whatever). She said the van belongs to my neighbor who is undergoing chemotherapy. That's why the van hadn't moved in forever. Apparently the 2014 license renewal sticker had simply fallen off. I felt like a big jerk for tattling on someone who is ill. Within the next week the van had moved parking spots twice so I felt guilty that this poor sick woman might be moving her van just because I had complained. I've seen my neighbor since and she's always been friendly to me. However she referred to herself as \"a big pain in the butt\" so I was a little worried my landlord had told her who had reported her van.\nToday's FU began when I was coming up the stairs from the basement, having put laundry into the washer. I ran into this neighbor and we began chitchatting. I mentioned that I had just had to completely clean out one of the washers because some terribly rude person washed a bunch of Kleenexes and left the washer completely disgusting. I practically had to climb into it to pull some of the tissue out of the drum. Shortly after this the conversation ended and I went back to my apartment. 30 minutes later when I went to move my clothes to the dryer the same neighbor was taking hers out of the dryer. She must've had the Kleenex in her laundry. Now I feel horrible for having complained right at her. Even if she wasn't sick I would have felt bad calling her a rude jerk right to her face, but she is on oxygen and everything and probably wasn't able to clean the washer out herself.

Before anyone says anything, I have met her before and she has a boyfriend of two years. However, she is very attractive (a much prettier version of myself) and shares the same interests as my boyfriend. They even used to live together with a bunch of other people. It makes me wonder why they haven't dated. Upon asking my boyfriend this, he has told me he has never hooked up with her, has had feelings for her, or is even attracted to her. He even has gone so far to say that he will never date her as she is like a little sister to him.\n\nSo lately, he told me that he wants to meet up in Thailand for a week  with her alone while she is on her extended backpacking trip to SE-Asia. We have argued about this several times. I continuously told him that this is disrespectful and I don't want him to go. Of course, he goes against my wishes. We recently got back together, so I would understand if he didn't want to go on a vacation with me just yet. \n\nI don't even mind if he went alone to Thailand or with a group, as long as he isn't alone with his female best friend. I find that to be disrespectful. He assures me that they will be staying in hostels with separate beds and he will call me via Skype every single day to make me feel better.

It was not a great combination. Her friend is in the hallway behind her, she's watching in a bit of shocked horror. Sensing that my welcome had run out, I stood up, at which point Emma announced she was going to castrate me as a punishment for being a horny teenager.\n\nThe following few moments of my comprehension of the statement and my rapid running the fuck away from her passed very quickly, and in my rush I took a wrong turn and ended up in a linen closet. Fuck.\n\nTurns out that as she was chasing me, her friend tried to grab her arm, got nicked by the knife, and went into shock.\nEmma breaks out of crazy mode and calls out for help.

I was a treasurer for a student accounting society for my university, and when some financial hardship hit, I made the idiotic decision to use my availability of funds to help front some money, with the intent to pay it back. However, before I was able to fully pay it back, the academic advisor of the group took notice and turned it over the university police who took it to the county. I was up front with all of my information and did not try to hide anything from them, knowing that they had access to all copies of the checks and had talked to the other student board members. August 14th, 2014 I was sentenced for a felony count of forgery through a county court. Being 23 and dealing with this completely on my own, I had to take a court appointed attorney, who was able to get the prosecutor to drop the other counts of forgery and embezzlement. In total, the amount in question was $4,000 which was paid as restitution in full amount on the date of sentencing. I never spent time in jail besides the 6 hours while I was waiting arraignment, I never had probation or any other court ordered conditions I unfortunately did not look into the possible pros of hiring an attorney versus taking a court appointed one, and now at 24, cannot find work.

I want to go home and spend it with my friends and family, I'll be home for Christmas which is great, but I don't get to go home very often (I spend about 9 - 10 months a year abroad) and I miss them a lot.

She's spending a fair amount of money to come and see me (she also has to get a visa to enter my country). I live about 1,000 miles from home so it's not MEGA far or expensive. Because she's visiting me twice and I don't want to be back for New Years it makes me feel like I'm being a bit selfish in the relationship. \n\nSo she feels I don't care about her as much because I'd rather be at home for NYE.

We're still friends on Facebook and Twitter and she *seems* like she's doing all right, but maybe she's just doing that to make me feel less guilty...? I don't know.\n\nI guess I'm just not sure what it is I'm feeling. I thought I'd be able to just move on and be fine because I was never really emotionally invested. Am I just bothered because she *seems* all right or do I really care more than I think I do? I want to send her an email (yes, an email of all things) and tell her what I'm going through and that maybe I'd like to hang out some time soon. I'm just afraid of building her hope (and mine?) up and then letting us both down if that feeling isn't there again...I'm not sure what i want to do here and I just don't know exactly what it is I'm going through. \n\nShould I send her an email? Should I try and get together with her and see if something is there? Should I even try? Or should I just delete her from social media and invoke a strict NC?

He is very business savy and wealthy. \n\nWe had lived together for a full 3 weeks, but being with a traveling business man is not easy, and he felt pressured into commitment. He being 42 told me I was not right to be his future wife, so he kicked me out. I am in my late 20s and very much in love with him. \n\nHe is cold but showed his love in the form of helping my company get off the ground. He invested time and money getting things set up for me. Suddenly he wants me gone but still hopes to participate in my business ventures. I begin no contact and he is shocked. I admit I stalked his facebook, he was depressed up until yesterday. Today I launched my online store and made a Tinder account (I found him there a week ago). Today he emails me a very business-like email saying how it's stupid talking through assistants when he could just contact me about my business plan. He offers all the financial and business help he knows I need. \n\nA part of me knows it's because he wants in on my future business (it's fucking genius) a part of me hopes it's because he hates waking up alone and being completely alone. He was incredibly depressed the last few weeks we were together. I was worried and asked him to get psych help. Now he's throwing money at the situation, asking for nothing in return. He knew I needed a couple of thousand for a lawyer, a bit more for merchandise, etc. He writes a detailed pricing email explaining me my business model but says he wants nothing more than my success and maybe a bit of his initial investment. \n\nI'm lost without him both emotionally and business-wise but somehow could make it work without him(loan from family), although not as well as he ever could, not a marketer at all. He knows this. Right now there is nothing tying me to him, except my feelings and need for business help.

I hate the way it looks. I think people won't think I'm attractive or won't want to talk to me if they initially view me from my \"bad side\". I know it's totally crazy and may be all in my head, but it's a problem that's plagued me for years. The worst part of it is that I have breathing problems. Now, I'm 21 and I met with a surgeon for the first time. He said that by fixing my septum (septoplasty), my breathing problems would be solved. Fixing my nose cosmetically is a totally different procedure (rhinoplasty). I know for sure that I want to fix my breathing, but here's the catch... if I fix my septum, I won't be able to go back later and do the rhinoplasty. Apparently it works the best if it's all done at once... doing any further cosmetic surgery can make it look weird. Costs aside, I have the chance to fix something that's bothered me for years, and now I'm afraid of the consequences. What if I hate the way I look afterwards? I have a feeling that if I pass up the chance, I'll totally regret it. I've come to terms with the fact that I've got a honker for a nose. It gives my face character and I kind of like that. In my mind, getting plastic surgery would be like giving up on myself. But the thought of looking in the mirror each day and not being bothered by it makes me want to get a rhinoplasty.

The joke spreads around like that, and is sort of stupid in my opinion. A few days later, I see he has posted to his wall \"My Grandmother went to heaven today.\" With the odd wording, and me hearing nothing of his grandma's ill health, I assumed it was another one of his prank posts to lure more people in to his silly joke. I thought it would be rather funny to mess with some of the believers in the comments of the post.\n\nI type \"Good riddance\" into the comments and, within seconds, I receive a reply from one of his friends I did not know saying \"That's horrible. Why would you say something like that?\" With a lack of better judgement, I decide not to hold back. I go on a rant spreading lies about his grandmother: \"She was a horrible person and a menace to society\", \"She even ran over my cat and never apologized\", \"I went to AssHat's house and saw alot of German WWII related items.\", \"That monster was literally a nazi!\", \"She's scum of the earth and we're better off without her.\"\n\nI felt pretty accomplished with my trolling, not even considering the possibilty his grandmother could have actually died.

My boyfriend is the type who rather spend his extra money and enjoy it.

I recently found out I was pregnant and figured I shouldn't overthink it and just tell her as I would have told her in the past (before knowing about her visits with fertility doctors etc). She responded very sweetly and is texting me asking several excited questions and there doesn't seem to be any weirdness at all. She seems genuinely thrilled that I'm going to be a mum!\n\nHowever, I'm still a little worried and overthinking things in my head. I am worried that deep down she is sad and how I should best respect her feelings without making it an issue. The fertility issues she is having would have stayed between her and her husband had it not been for an awkward visit with my mother. My mum visited her (my parents also live in a different country.) and she had to tell my mum because there were so many secret appointments etc. My mum is not the most tactful person and rather than understand it was a private issue just got incredibly excited they were trying, to the point that when she left their house she left a note and candles in their bedroom wishing them luck. Cringe. So my sister and I have been bonding over how cheesy our mum is being.\n\nI'm looking for advice on how to go forward. Should I just pretend that everything is normal and follow her cues? Should I be more sensitive about the subject because of what she is going through?\n\nI can't help but feel guilty.

Being the immature teenage boy I was, I teased this girl. I remember meeting her and talking to her for a little while at an Interact service (A community service club in my high school). After a week or two with us going about our lives, I was walking down the hallway and she just saw me holding my bag of chips and was like \"You owe me chips,\" as a friendly gesture.\n\nAgain, me being the immature guy I was, I played along with it. Whenever I saw her in the hallway, I would be like \"You owe me chips!\" and she would say \"No, you owe me chips wtf.\" One day after school, I started doing this in front of her friends and embarrassed her. She thought I was just being funny and enjoyed it. One day, I bought myself a couple bags of chips and I tried giving one to her, but she rejected. Although I was pretty persistant about giving it to her, she still said no. Now that I think about it, even though she said no playfully, I now know that she was getting pretty damn annoyed.\n\nThe next day during lunch time, I walked by her table and threw the bag onto her lap. I kid you not, this girl got up and started booking it to me with the intention of trying to give it back to me, so I went along with it and started a chase. After maybe like 50 feet, I hear a slam on the ground. I look back and I saw that she ate shit, in front of 70+ other people. Her three-week old phone cracked, elbow scrapped, knee bleeding. Yeah, it was a pretty bad fall.\n\nI walked her to the nurse's office, embarrassed as hell and expecting her to yell the shit out of me, but she didn't, thankfully. I helped her clean up her wounds, bandaged them, and apologized. Since then, she hasn't said a word to me and just ignored me when she saw me.

I leave for school on bad terms with both, ex-boyfriend blocks my number, refuses to talk to me, etc.\n\nFast forward September college freshman, meet and begin dating new guy I meet at school. Fall in love with him and we are together currently, doing well and are both happy.  The ex-boyfriend contacts me approximately two weeks prior, I tell the current boyfriend of our  interaction.  I end up writing pages and pages to ex-boyfriend, and think maybe he has feelings? He wants to stop talking; I get upset; he tells me he still loves me and wants to be together and is sorry for everything.\n\nI feel bad for even considering the possibility of being with my ex-boyfriend again.  My current relationship has its ups and its downs, but is still beautiful and wonderful.  I am going home for work purposes in two weeks, as is the ex-boyfriend, and we are meeting and talking. Is it possible to love two people at once? Am I holding onto residual feelings? I feel bad for my current boyfriend and my ex and cannot distinguish my feelings for which one to be with.  It is unfair to both and I don't want to feel guilty and bad again but I also don't want to make the wrong choice.

He listens to all basic commands and makes good eye contact most of the time. He is quite defensive of the yard and property. If someone comes to the door or a loud car drives by he barks and growls. He quickly quiets down when you ask him to. (Most of the time except when he is in the yard alone) He gets along very well with other dogs and people. If someone new is coming to the house he is standoffish at first but quickly is very friendly. (As long as I say its ok) He is well excercised for the most part. (Walk to a field and then 45 minutes+ of running/fetch/frisbee) In the winter time he goes outside less but doesn't seem to act any differently. I do alot of indoor training/play with him as well.\n\nThe other day my friends phone rang and he stood up about to answered it. At the same time my dog started growling and attacked him. He stopped after a few seconds (gave him sit commands etc) but was still very heated. My friend went in the other room for his phone call and it seemed like my dog wanted to follow him. We both thought the ringtone agitated him.\n\nAre there any clear cut training methods to stop this behavior? It happened twice now with two different people.

Our relationship experienced a downward spiral of anger and sadness because he wasn't following through. Finally after a few attempts I just broke it off because the constant depression that his failure to follow through put me in was killing me.\n\nI never told him I still loved him at the end (I did indeed love him before but purposefully began distancing myself to try and protect myself from the seemingly eventual demise of our relationship) and just said he was wonderful and I wished he'd made the choices he said he would.

We have been together for 2.5 years and the past few times we have hung out, we have not had sex or he rebuffed my advances. He chalked it up to low energy and stress a few things which I understood, but it just felt very off. Not only could I not recall when we were having sex but when we did it wasn't good at all. At first he didn't agree with my sentiment about less sex, and in fact decided to point out my own shortcomings (regarding domestic tasks) but he took the initiative to initiate and it's been great. In fact, we've been having some  of the best sessions we've ever had, and I feel that he used techniques he's never used before (sorry if it's TMI). I thought we were happy.\n\nThe next morning, we were joking around and it came to the point where I jokingly mentioned that he was trying to turn me into a housewife and he mentioned I was trying to turn him into a sex slave. That threw me off, but I let it go because I assumed he was joking. However, the very next day we were recalling the previous night's session and how much he enjoyed it. I casually brought up the sex slave comment. He then goes on to show the apparently grotesque face I made multiple times and how I was basically forcing his head.\n\nIt seemed like it was in the vein of joking but I felt humiliated. I feel sex is such a vulnerable state and his comments made me feel that he wasn't really into it and having a laugh at my expense, perhaps even resentful that he had to.

This is a fact, everyone I've talked to about this has said that I didn't do anything wrong and that it wasn't my fault. Even though I know that this is true My self esteem is destroyed. I'm usually a very chipper and funny person to be around according to my friends and right know I feel like they don't want me around because I can't be happy now. I want to know how to cheer myself up.\n\n I've tried distracting myself with almost everything I can but for some reasoning keep thinking about her and her new guy fucking. It's a guy wrenching feeling and for some reason my thoughts keep going back to that. He is more attractive.That he will make her happier. That he will please her better. That I am inferior in every way possible.  How can I stop thinking and picturing anything to do with her?\n\nAnother problem I'm having is that after being with her for so long and being in such a small town I feel like no one will take me. It is known that her and I we're together by everyone and I feel that I am now undesirable. That on top of the fact that I never really learned how to e single. Is there anywhere I can learn how to flirt. Learn how to at least not be completely inept with the opposite sex? Like an r4r but not physical.

Unfortunately my time abroad had a expiration date and we broke up just before I left. After trying to drastically limit our communication for several post break-up months, we finally admitted that we still very much had feelings for each other.\n\nThe first couple months of the long distance relationship went amazingly smoothly, but eventually I felt her start to draw away. We would talk and the responses would be more curt, and where we used to waste hours just incessantly texting back and forth, we eventually settled in to a likely more healthy, but slower pattern of communication. She also took to tweeting extremely cryptic things, while for the most part putting on a happy face during our communications.\n\nI deal with some insecurity and depression for which I'm supposed to be taking meds. And her changed behavior gave me some anxiety about the status of our relationship, especially because on facebook she maintained the same active social life, going out with her mostly male friends who had during my time abrouad made their dislike of me very obvious.\n\nHer distance and the tweets deviated enough from her normal behavior that I finally addressed it on Skype, and she eventually admitted that she had these intense feelings of depression and external pressure and was in therapy for her issues, but for the most part refused to elaborate beyond that. \n\nThis conversation happened maybe two months ago, and since then we've gone through different extremes, extremely close and upbeat to distant and withdrawn. I want to help and play a larger role than a supportive voice through her computer screen. I think she for the most part tunes out whatever affirming comments I give her. \n\nWe have days where things are incredible, but then she falls back into a depressive cycle and I feel like white noise against everything else.

However, while I logically acknowledge his, it's hard for me to feel it emotionally. \n\nEarly on in our relationship (March-mid June), he underwent a lot of life stress that caused him to become a completely different person - he was distant, doubting the relationship for no good reason, regularly 1-3 hours late to meet me, etc. We talked about breaking up (amicably) but we didn't. During this time, I tried my best to be understanding and I basically put aside my needs (e.g. affection or wanting to hang out more) so that he could have space to deal with his stress. As a result of everything, I became a little depressed and also incredibly, frequently anxious about everything.\n\nNow, he is back to being wonderful, affectionate, supportive, and considerate again. However, because I've been habituated to negative norms for those 3 months, I have a hard time re-setting and accepting the new norm. Even though things have been good for 2 months now, I'm still  cripplingly anxious. I still don't give him the benefit of the doubt. I still worry that we are on the edge of breaking up. \n\nWe've talked a lot about this and we don't know what to do. I know that his feelings and actions in his stressful period are no longer relevant or applicable. He's debunked some of my worries, like my fear that he doesn't think our relationship is good. He's working to address my needs. I know I need to get over the past, but I don't know how. My pent-up emotions are now bubbling over and I'm more irritable, negative, and accusative, but I don't want to be.

This is my first serious relationship. Our first couple years were great and honeymoon-y. But lately we are constantly arguing primarily because he thinks that I am not as committed to the relationship as he is. \n\nHe tells me that I don't include him when we are together, I lack empathy, and I deliberately make jokes at his expense. He is also worried that I will leave him for a macho guy who is more reserved with his emotions like I am because he knows how much it bothers me when he brings up these flaws of mine. \n\nI should also mention that through this first year of college he has become depressed and insecure with himself. One night when he was drinking with friends he saw his buddy and buddy's girlfriend get into a fight because the girl said she knew a guy who was more attractive than her boyfriend. My boyfriend then asked me over text if I thought anyone was more attractive that him. I thought he would know I was lying if I said no one, so I told him I did and he demanded that I tell him who. I listed 2 people and he has not been able to trust me the same ever since. His confidence is now squashed beyond repair and he thinks more than ever that I'll leave him for someone better. \n\nI love him so much and just 2 months ago I could see us getting married and having a future, and that's a major part that makes the idea of ending it so difficult. But the more he accuses me of not being committed, the more I think he is right and feel like I should just end it. I don't want to prove him right that I didn't care about him enough, and I don't want to intensify his depression by bringing his fears to life. but I also don't want to stay in a relationship that is unhealthy and doomed to fail anyway. \n\nI'm not fishing for affirmations here, feel free to tell me that I'm being a dick.

{"info": {"id": "t3_4zik27", "post": "Backstory: I moved to a new city about 6 months ago for a job where i met my friend Jane. During our training we became good friends, have some shared interests etc, but after training finished we haven't seen each other that much because of the type of work that we do (different shifts and etc).\n\nAbout the same time i met my gf, Sophie, who is just the sweetest and who i really care about. We dont share that many friends, she has hers and i have mine.\n\nProblem: Jane and I spoke a lot about how we love going to music festival etc, and how we should get together with the rest of the friends we made during our training and take some time off at the same time. We planned this quite early on (before i was serious with my gf), and we both applied for leave quite early for september (hoping that our friends would hop on once they saw we had booked our days off).

We agreed that the date was going really well and that we would see each other again.  The date lasted just around 2 hours.\n\nNow, I would have gone in for a kiss, or developed some kino, but I got the impression from her that she would want to move slower.  She had brought up an ex boyfriend (red flag, but the discussion was more about what we had learned from our past relationships).  We also discussed casual sex, and how we weren't interested in it. Again, I was very comfortable talking to her about these issues, which is uncommon for me. These topics suggested to me that moving slower would be best.\n\nSo, today, I text her for a second date.

We started off as a friends and would constantly flirt, talk about sex, wrestle, and cuddle; pretty much every indicator that we both wanted sex to happen. And eventually it did; we became friends with benefits.  The sex was amazing, and daily. We even decided to try for having sex 100 times in 100 days. At day 20 we'd had sex 27 times, and this included being apart for a week. She was insatiable, I could barely keep up with her.\n\nEven before we started having sex I'd always had a thing for her, and as time went on we started spending more and more time together.

To my joy she said yes. \n\nAnd almost immediately after we actually became a couple, her libido bombed. Circumstances beyond control forced us to cancel our attempt at 100 times in 100 days, and in the three short months since we've become official we've gone from sex one or two times a day to having sex maybe once or twice a week. More than that, she's no longer as receptive or interested in flirting the way we used to before we became a 'we'.\n\nI'm a very, very sexual person, I feel that a healthy, frequent sex life is essential to a strong relationship.

I was seeing that girl from the US more frequently from week to week and started to get more interested in her. As time passed by, I lost 28 pounds in almost 4 months (mid march to end june) just because of her. I was weighing 117 pounds in march last year and got my weight down to 89 pounds which felt very good and I didn't even have any issues with my health and even now I don't.\n\nThe thing is that I didn't really have to lose so much weight in such a short time but I still did it because I just wanted to talk to her which -in the end- I couldn't do because she had moved from Germany over to England. I gained like 15 pounds back in the time from july to february this year. I then started to do sports again and lost 5 pounds already which is good but now the problem is that -like last time- I feel very empty inside because of all the hope I had back then and I also have now.\n\nWhy now? Because I'm chatting with a girl for a few days now and she seems to be very interested in me I guess. I have to mention that I felt quiete normal until yesterday.

He says he thought she was perfect, and that his senior year when he was dating her was the best of his life. But that then she went to school and decided he wasn't as important to her as she had said. That messed him up, and he admits he shouldn't have believed she was perfect. But he says ever since that break up he hasn't felt capable of feeling deep feelings, and that now he is feeling anxious because he thinks maybe we are at that stage...and that so far he has been very guarded (I have too).\n\nI got upset because that means at the beginning of the relationship he knew he couldn't feel deep feelings. I didn't think that was fair to me. And I don't want to have to \"coach\" someone into feeling again...I shouldn't have to.

We have a ton in common and get along really well. When we see each other we typically go on fun/unique dates and started having sex regularly about a month into hanging out. We haven't had any sort of discussion about our relationship yet. My personal take on our relationship is that it's casual but consistent. I'm definitely developing feelings for him and could potentially see it turning into something more serious down the line (but I would be fine with it staying casual). \n\nThings all changed two weeks ago. I had met his friends on numerous occasions at this point so I figured it wouldn't be weird if he met some of my friends. I was going to be hanging out with two of my friends (a couple) so I invited him along. The entire evening was awkward. I'm not sure what even made it awkward, but the dynamic and everything was just off. And since then we've barely spoken and I've only seen him once. I've been initiating all the conversations and asked him to hang out numerous times. He took me to dinner last week at my own suggestion (a week after the friend date disaster) and it was lovely/normal. Afterwards he invited me back to his place but he was tired and didn't want to have sex so I left shortly after. He's initiated conversation with me twice since then but doesn't respond to my replies when I do answer and hasn't made any sort of effort to see me.\n\nI'm guessing that he's slow fading me. But I'm really confused as to why. Everything was going so well for two months, and suddenly things changed completely. I don't want to continue to text him or ask him to hangout again. However, is it okay to call him out on the slow fade thing and ask him what's up? I wouldn't be bothered if we hadn't been seeing each other for over two months at this point.

At first I declined because I'm not very experienced so I felt like he could find someone else. I gradually became more accustomed to the idea so basically in the last 2 years I've been in a quasi-FWB situation. We fooled around several times but he was always the one to get off. He never pressured me into sex or expected it, which was nice.\n\nBut when I wanted to start fooling around more and was ready to have sex with him he was never in the mood or wouldn't respond. He's said that his arousal comes and goes for him, I think partially because of emotional baggage from his last relationship. It just made me feel used. Being sexually and emotionally frustrated sucks, but we've talked a lot about the issue without any formal resolution. Some things got resolved, but not everything. I felt less used because he was really open and honest and vulnerable with me.\n\nSomething that has somewhat complicated things is that I started to develop a crush on him. It lasted about a month and we talked about it. I am over it now because a relationship with him is unrealistic and not what I'm looking for but I do get a little jealous when I see other girls flirting with him (I usually just walk away in that situation). But as far as I know he hasn't hooked up with anyone since we've been fooling around.\n\nThis is just a mess of a situation I should just walk away from, right? Our friendship seems to be fine.

One was an administrative job and the other was a production job. When I had called to question why they never offered those positions to me (I was very poignant and called the temp service twice a week to see what was available); they said that was just so that they could get people in to put in applications! I said, why do they need more applications when they can not even find jobs for the people that have already signed up!\n\nAnd I really want to say thanks to reddit because I did take a lot of advice here to heart. I wish I could link to the posts and give due credit. One post was something along the lines of: (Dealing with confidence issues) \"Just fake it until you make it.\" Another post was a very informative post on askreddit about tips for when you actually do get interviews that said that s/he added at the end of the interview, when asked if s/he had any questions said: \"What can I do or say today that will give me this job tomorrow?\" (I totally said this!)", "title": "After nearly a year of countless applications...", "subreddit": "self"}, "split": "valid1", "summaries": [{"text": " After nearly a year of countless applications, I finally got a job!

Recently though, when she was having a bad night, he came over and they ended up kissing. From what she's said, she immediately cut things off there and had him leave.

I can't remember why, but at one point he went to his texts and gave it a big scroll back (I didn't see how far). As it came to a stop, a text from \"Diane\" saying \"Fo sho\" caught my eye. I don't know that name, but I didn't really think anything of it, as my boyfriend works freelance and talks to a lot of people, most of whose names I don't know.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I found myself occasionally wondering who Diane was. I didn't want to make my boyfriend feel accused, and I trust him, but after a while I figured what's the harm in asking. I'll ask, he'll tell me she's one of his students' moms or something, and all will be fine.\n\nSo last night after dinner, we were hanging out and I said as casually and not accusing a way as possible, \"hey, I know this is silly and I'm sorry for worrying about something so meaningless, but can you tell me who Diane is? I saw a text from someone by that name while you were on your phone a few weeks ago.\"\n\nHe had no idea what I was talking about. Doesn't know any Diane. He pulled out his phone, went to his texts, and searched for \"Diane\" and the words \"fo sho.\" Zero results. He scrolled back to almost a year, no Diane. He said he was sorry he didn't have an answer but that he hasn't deleted any of his texts. He took me in his arms and promised me he has never lied to me.\n\nSo I guess either he's lying, or I didn't see that text, right? I'm sort of desperate for a third possibility.

Along the California border, I had the bright idea to take a side road between Interstate 10 and Interstate 8 to save time. It was about 3 in the morning and there were no cars within miles on either side of me when all of a sudden I see a car come speeding up with its left turn light blinking. I slowed down to let it pass but instead the driver started creeping up to my bumper and refusing to pass. No big deal, waited for a passable zone and slowed down to allow him to pass. By now, I'm going about 25 in a 60 and he is still riding my bumper. Freaked out a little bit, I sped up to 85, he's still on my ass. We're hauling ass through the Imperial Sand Dunes Rec area when all of a sudden another car comes up with its emergency lights flashing. The car that had initially followed me now started trying to box me in on the left side and run me off the road. I kept swerving back and forth to make it really difficult.\nAs I neared the town of Brawley, I decided I had to make a move. I slammed the brakes with both cars right on me, they swerved and stopped about 50 feet in front of me, just sitting there. I sat in the middle of the road facing either direction while they watched us for about 10 minutes.

How do couples navigate social media?\n\nThree. He makes no effort to detail his past dating history. He does not hide his past, but he does not make an effort to inform me of everything that has occurred in the past. If I want to know if he used to date someone I have to ask.

I haven't solved my photography dilemma yet and I could really use some advice. \n\nIdeally, I would like to hire a photographer for just a few hours. I'd like to have group family photos (and photos of me and FH) taken before the ceremony, maybe an hour total. I would also like photos to be taken during the ceremony, which should only last about 20 minutes, and during the hour-long cocktail hour. Plus maybe the first 45 minutes or hour of the reception, but that's negotiable. That's about three or four hours total. I don't have a bridal party and the number of people I want in the photos is probably a total of 20 (most of whom will be only in a couple of photos). I do not expect an album of 500 wedding photos.\n\nI truly value photography as an art and don't want to come across as insulting. It's just that my FH and I aren't terribly keen on posing for photos. Here's what I don't want: cutesy group photos, photos of my FH and I gazing longingly at each other, getting ready photos, photos of my dress before I put it on, ring photos, etc. It's not about money. I just don't need a full day of photography.\n\nSo my questions are: is it possible to find a decent quality photographer willing to do this? If so, how do I go about finding one? How much should I expect to pay (very, very generally)?

The group happened to include several young children that were ever so excited for Christmas day to come. In the restaurant some small talk and simple conversation was going on while my brother and I started to joke about the little ones. Due to my joking mindset at the time, I wasn't thinking about who I was really talking to, and when one of the kids started to say,\"I want santa to get me a new Xbox One\", I spurted out the first thing on my mind and loudly commented, \"**Well its a damn shame that Santa Claus is just mommy and daddy!**\". Instantly after that, the table was filled with silence and loud tears as the faces with ajar mouths stared at me in disgust. When i tried to divert my attention to the daggers being shot at me from around the table, I looked around the restaurant to find that many of the other patrons where giving me rude looks as well as the family and friends. Instantly my father grabbed me by the shirt and dragged me to the parking lot and talked to me about the how the three little lives that i had just ruined had been so distraught the friends of ours had to leave the restaurant. Later when we went home, we received a call saying that the kids were still crying, and that one started to destroy all of the boxes under the Christmas tree because of his loss of faith. After that I realized that all of the apologizing in the world would not fix the three little, wonderful broken hearts that i had done. So now, the rest of my Christmas break contains hard, long hours of labor at my family's friends house, and now my dad is making me find a Santa look-alike on craigslist to help stoke their belief again.

My girlfriend is an American expat who has been living here for about 3 years. We've been dating for two years and have been living together for about 6 months.\n\nAbout three months ago, I met another girl, also a foreign student. I was instantly physically attracted to her, but didn't think much of it, things like this happen all the time. However, after getting to know her better over a period of two weeks I fell in love hard. I could tell she had similar feelings for me, but I kept her at a distance because I didn't want to betray my girlfriend's trust. I have considered leaving my girlfriend to pursue a relationship with the other girl but have decided against it. I love my girlfriend very much, she has inspired me to make a lot of positive changes in my life over the time we've been together and I am happy and proud to be with her. Also a relationship with her is far more likely to bring me happiness in the future. The other girl is the kind of girl I used to go for in the past and a relationship with her would most likely only end in heartbreak.\n\nOn a night out with some of my friends I ran into the ''other girl'' and a group of her friends. Long story short, I came very close to spending the night with her but instead ended up destroying any chance of us being together, like I had decided before. I'm still not entirely sure whether I did it because I wanted to or because I felt like I had to.\n\nAbout a full month has passed since then, but I can't get the other girl out of my mind. I think about her constantly, even when I'm with my girlfriend. I feel guilty about it and I feel it's still effecting my relationship.

We were just getting to know each other at first, but things kept snowballing as we got to know each other and we got more emotionally involved. She has been back once since then and things kept building to the point that we were talking about life plans when she returned.\n\nThe problem is that she's now not going to return for several years.\n\nThe plan was that she would be back here for graduate school, but it turns out that she got an offer she can't turn down somewhere else. It's going to be a multi-year commitment of lots of work, and there's no guarantee she will ever be back here, even though it's currently part of her long-term plan.\n\nSo the options now are to give up or go with her. Neither really feels like the right choice. I encouraged her to go to the school because the offer was too good to pass up, and I'm not about to ask her to take out substantially larger amounts of debt so we can be together. But with her going to school, she will be locked in for several years and maybe longer once she starts her career. I can travel to see her more often than we have so far, but ultimately, I would have to move at some point. \n\nAs for me, I'm further in my career, and it's unfortunately not one where good opportunities come up very often. I also have friends, connections and a current job where I am and wouldn't have chosen the city she's moving to for myself if I were to move. I worry that if I go, she will be all I have in this new place.\n\nWe both want to be with each other and have said that we thought this could be a lifelong relationship. We are both heartbroken at the thought of giving up, but staying together doesn't seem to be an option either.\n\nAny words of wisdom from someone who has made long-distance work?

She asked him what had happened and if they even used protection but he wouldn't admit to anything. He wouldn't even say that they had sex. Soon after rumors circulated as they do in high school. She was always known as being incredibly innocent, hell she is a pastor's daughter, but now guys started asking her out of the blue if she would have sex with them if she was drunk. Also rumors got out that she was pregnant (she wasn't).\nAll this had a devastating impact on her self esteem and ego, meanwhile her boyfriend had gotten seriously depressed and was absolutely intolerable to deal with. The guy from the party started talking to her again. They met a few times under different circumstances, he would get her drunk, and have sex with her.\nShe left her boyfriend and soon after stopped seeing the other guy too.

I told him that I was here to answer any questions about applications he might have. He seemed to really take it to heart. He has really been knocking the applications out and has applied to 15+ places in the last few days. \n\nHe's been realizing that even if it's just part time it is something to put on his resume to show that he's working. He's looking at it in the perspective of, get a job now and look for something better. That way he still has an income to contribute and can work on finding something with more hours/better pay. \n\nHis depression is getting better now, too. I think me working 40 hours a week was eating at him and now that he's really trying harder to find a job, he seems happier. I know he's still struggling a bit with everything.

I need help getting started down the right path to losing weight. I've been saying that I would be healthier for a while now, but at this point im not even 100% sure I know what that means.\n\nA little background about me, I am a 22 y/o M that currently weighs between 385-390 lbs. I am currently working full time and going to graduate school (which leaves me tired and gives little time to do anything else). I am a former athlete, I was actually playing two sports in college as recent as april, but ive spiraled downwards since then. I was 280 pounds when I graduated high school and 340 when I graduated college. In the four months  since ive graduated ive gained 45 pounds mostly due to continuing my crap eating habits (way too much fast food and fried food) without really working out. \n\nI've known for a while that I needed to make a serious change, but it didnt really hit me until this morning when I went to put on a button up shirt for work and it ripped when I bent over. I know that this has gotten kind of rambling, but I guess the core question is how do you start? How did you break your fast food and junk food addiction and learn how to eat right (And what to even eat in the first place)? How do you motivate yourself to work out when you have little time and you're exausted (on tuesday-thursday I leave the house at 6:30am and get back at 8:15pm, so I feel like I never have the time to work out). What workouts did you do that you felt helped the most with limited time?\n\nSorry that this got so long, and if you read this far I really thank you.

The spring thaw has yet to come at this point, and the previous evening we had some freezing rain and then later a blanket of snow to cover everything up. Normally I am one of those people who usually waits a little bit longer than they should to do household chores. Today I decide I'm going to have the trash out to the curb well before the garbage man rolls up instead of 5 minutes beforehand like I usually do.

Used newspapers are now blowing into the neighbor's yard, and I can just barely begin to smell the rotting food from the day before when I cleaned out the refrigerator. I slowly get up and limp back into the house, with any thought of cleaning up the mess I have just made as far off as the glass bottles that are now rolling down the hill. I quickly realized this is not going to be just a simple bruise but that I in fact broke my wrist and arm. Now here is the kicker. As my brother pulled up to my house to drive me to the ER,  who else but the salt truck decides to roll up my street and plow at that very moment.

We never argued a lot, but there were very rare occurrences when we didn't get along. I had already been ignored for a week once--as if my presence wasn't there at all--and I always assumed it was simply because I had said something wrong (I apologise to her, I swear). But we would always get along, eventually.\n\nIn the remaining several days before we had to part for summer, our interactions were becoming a little awkward, and it was with the knowledge that I would already be attending a different school from hers when classes return. In those days, I would see her making conversations with other students rather than me. She would always speak to my only other best friend (the three of us have been really close friends for > 4 years), and not include me in the conversation. My online messages are all unread. I have, of course, asked her if I had done something wrong; she would say \"no\", as always, without looking me in the eye.\n\nAnd now she has finally blocked me in social media. 3 months have passed now, and I cannot even fathom what wrong I could have possibly done. I don't have much friends. Now that I am in a new university, I could simply forget that part of my past and move on, but I cannot bring myself to do so. You can't just forget years of shared experiences, right?\n \n\nHell, I even dream about her sometimes. I adore her as a great friend, no less. But in those last few days together, she'd just blatantly ignore me, and wouldn't at least tell me what I've done wrong--and that really hurts me.

When I asked for it to be toned down a bit, since I only have so much time in a day she would get mad.  \n\n  Things moved fast, she said I was pushy about sex and maybe I was, but I was confused because we were both naked in her bed, she undressed first,  after 3 weeks of seeing each other and I thought that was coming that night. So she kind of got mad after I asked her if we were doing it that night. Anyways we made up the next day and things went the same. Another night we are in the same situation. We had just talked about waiting then all of the sudden she gets on me and we are do it. I was confused. We do it again the next day and then she says she feels bad about it and I have had enough confusion at this point so I get mad because she is making a big deal about it.

I contacted her today, and we met and she finally answered my questions. \n\nShe did like me. She did have feelings for me, and she was excited to explore these feelings and go on dates with me. She had an excellent time on the last date we went on, until she got home and her roommates told her that it was obvious that I was crushing on her.

She is normally excited to see him, which is fine, but she follows him around all of the time and cannot take her eyes off of him. Even if I am playing with her or petting her or engaging her, if he is there, she is staring at him.
