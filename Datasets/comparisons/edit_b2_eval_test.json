{"info": {"post": "I don't know how to ask this without it sounding really silly, but this is a genuine problem. I created a throwaway because of too much personal detail in my main account. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are both grad students and have been together for four months now. I absolutely love him. He's sweet, caring, tolerant, liberal, basically every single thing on my 'checklist', if I had one, is there. \n\nThe problem, though, is he talks VERY slowly. I mean his speed is really slow. If I ask him anything, he takes about 3 seconds before he starts to talk, then when he starts, the words go at a very slow pace,and he even pauses for 3-5 seconds in the middle of his sentence. I get really impatient and sometimes just feel like telling him to hurry up (of course I don't, but I really feel like doing so). \n\nI asked him today, very gently, why he spoke so slow, and he said he just gets thoughts very slowly in his brain. He then went on to say he's just generally slow at thinking. I felt really sad when he said this, I don't know why. He's a Math PhD student,and we are at a pretty good school, and his research has been going slow for a while now (but this is totally normal in grad school), so I think that response was kind of a self-deprecating one since he's already low on self-esteem. \n\nAnyway, my point is, his speed of talking is just a part of him, it can't be changed. I love him so much otherwise but I just want to know how to deal with this. Conversation is so important in a relationship! How do we manage? He's an introvert and talks very little in general; I suspect this has something to do with his pace of talking?", "title": "Me [27 F] with my boyfriend [24 M] for four months now, he talks very slow.", "subreddit": "r/relationships"}, "split": "valid2", "summaries": [{"text": "Boyfriend talks very slowly, I feel frustrated and sometimes want to tell him to hurry up - how do I deal with this?", "policy": "human_editor", "note": null}, {"text": "Boyfriend talks very slowly, I feel frustrated and sometimes want to tell him to hurry up - how do we deal with this?", "policy": "sup4_6b_t0.7", "note": null}], "choice": 0, "worker": "soP7Okyp0e1WdYxQC9IldpwnznT6V1", "batch": "edit_b2_eval_test", "extra": {"confidence": 2}}
{"info": {"post": "I honestly do not care anymore. \n\nExcluding physicians and dentist, I am so sick of reading up on forums about how one career path in the medical field is over now that it is saturated and that the job prospects are completely made up. Time and time again people are complaining how even years after their graduation, they are unable to find a job.\n\nRegarding physicians and dentistry (which was the career I was originally pursuing), the tuition rates have become insane. At this point the average tuition rate for dental school is about 400k and rising. \n\nWhat is the point of working so hard in school and in life just to come out of school with a monstrous amount of debt.\n\nThe physician career is out of the question for me. There is no way I am going to kill myself studying 7 additional years of my life just to be overworked the rest of my life.\n\nAt this point I would think working for Starbucks or Walgreens and working your way up the ladder would be a better choice.\n\nPlease offer me some guidance because I have a few major science exams coming up within the next few days and I have lost all motivation to study.\n\nI grew up thinking the medical field was the safe career choice. Where job security was guaranteed. That if you just work hard, you will be successful and life will turn out easy.\n\nI honestly do not see any light at the end of this awful tunnel of careers in the medical field.\n\nThe reason I am emphasizing the medical field is because I grew up with healthcare all around my family so that is kind of my background.\n\nPlus I will soon be graduating with a biochemistry degree.\n\nI am not necessarily restricting myself to the medical field so I do welcome any kind of career advice or suggestions.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.
